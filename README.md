# Calculator Python Project

### In this project I developed a calculator using Python with the following functions
- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division
- square root
- square
### Utilized CSV files to run unit tests in Pycharm to ensure the calculator was running correctly.
### Created a Docker File for the Calculator and tested the Docker File as well
### Committed and Pushed the Calculator and associated files to a New Repository using Git
